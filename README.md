# StarEngine
Star is a homemade physics engine.

Since this project's purpose is to learn how to do a physics engine, every big step can be changed (what needs to be done in each).

## TODO
- Implementing the followings in order: Math library, Graphics engine (renderer), Physics engine

## Descriptions of each library/engine to developp and what needs to be done

### Math library
For starter this library will have 3 majors sections 2D, 3D and 4D (for orthographic projections) and each will contains:
    
    Point, Vector, Matrix (including transformation matrix) and Quaternions

### Graphics Engine (rendering engine)
This section will be filled when the math library will be over or almost done.

### Physics engine
This section will be filled when the math library will be over or almost done.
